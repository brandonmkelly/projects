				<h5>
					<em>Super Smash Bros Melee</em> is the sequel to Super Smash Bros for the Nintendo 64, and it is an upgrade in every respect, with much higher detail models, a much tighter physics engine with fluid animations, and a much more advanced AI, the game to this day is still played comptitively even after 2 sequels, soon to be 3 with the release of Super Smash Bros Ultimate.

			<p>
				<h5>
					<em>Luigi's Mansion</em> is Luigi's first game where he is the protagonist instead of his considerable more famous brother, Mario. It is about a haunted mansion that Luigi wins, and where Mario has disappeared into. Armed with nothing but a flashlight and a strange vacuum that consumes ghosts, Luigi, not the bravest person, must rescue his brother and uncover the secrets of the mansion. It was a very fun game.

				<h5>
					<em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em> was the first Fire Emblem game to feature 3D models, as up until then all characters were modeled with sprites. It is a strategic game akin to chess, where you and the enemy take turns moving units and fighting eachother until a goal is met, usually routing all units, but sometimes capturing a spot or defending a spot. Combat obeys a Rock-Paper-Scissors like set of rules for its main combat triangle, the Lance-Sword-Axe. It is set in a low fantasy world with political intrigue and philosophical pondering, and does not fail to make it challenging.

				<h5>
					<em>Pikmin</em> is a story about a crash landing onto an unknown, hostile planet. With an awful lot of similarities to our own. Except Captain Olimar is about the size of a quarter. He enlists the aid of sentient plants, which Olimar names Pikmin, as they remind him of PikPik carrots from home. The Pikmin follow his every order tirelessly, and the game is a test of how well you can micromanage an small army of these frankly adorable little workers. Different color Pikmin have different attributes, and you will need to familiarize yourself with them if you're to have any hope of leaving the toxic oxygen-rich planet before your O2 filter cuts out in 30 days. I've personally been able to finish the game on Day 14/30 with all ship parts, it's very much replayable!

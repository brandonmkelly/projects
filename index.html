						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Sega Genesis</em> was Sega's dash into 16 bit gaming, with iconic mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, the fastest thing alive. It was a very fun system.

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Sega Saturn</em> was Sega's attempt at a disc-based gaming console. While powerful, it simply was outsold by the much more successful PlayStation.

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Sega DreamCast</em> was an ambitious console whose lack of advertisement bit it in the bud and was outsold by the GameCube. This console was ahead of its time with a memory card that had an LCD display with interactive minigames from game save files, akin to Tomagatchis.

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Super Nintendo</em> was the upgrade from the NES, and was where Mario began to flourish, using a new cartridge design with an easy to eject design. It was also one of the first consoles to get a Game Genie (a cheat cartridge between the game and the console) made for it. This is a classic, and has been rereleased as such!

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Neo Geo Pocket</em> is a little known handheld console produced by SNK. It was nice, had a horoscope app, and a small library. Not bad, just not popular.
							</h5>

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Gameboy Color</em> was one of the first handheld consoles that had a color display, natch. It also managed to reduce the number of batteries needed by half compared to its predecesor, the GameBoy.
							</h5>

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Game Boy Advance</em> boasted a much more powerful processor and better rom technology with its compact cartridges, while still being backwards compatible with all Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, a trend which shapes the industry to this day.

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Nintendo 64</em> was Nintendo's grand entrance into the 3D world of gaming, and they made an incredible splash with Super Mario 64, a beautiful game still being speedrun today. Though dated now, the graphics were incredible for their time, and even had an optional RAM expansion pack for more demanding games like Donkey Kong 64.

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>GameCube</em> was a huge step up from the Nintendo 64, and featured Nintendo's version of game discs which were about half the size of standard DVD discs. The GameCube featured incredibly detailed models compared to the polygons of the N64, and also had a separately sold Game Boy adapter that plugged into the bottom, as well as controller adapters to use a Game Boy Advance (SP) as a controller.

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Nintendo 3DS</em> was, quite frankly, revolutionary at the time, with 3D features requiring no proprietary glasses to view properly, and flash drive game cartridges with massive storage capabilities, as well as having an SD Card slot! The touch screen is also much more refined compared to its predecessor the Nintendo 2DS. The 3DS is also compatible with add-ons such at the second joystick along with additional shoulder buttons, leading to a prolonged and excellent run of quality games. I personally own more 3DS games than any other system except possibly the Playstation 3.

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Wii</em> is the successor to the GameCube, and features a wireless infrared remote control with adapter for additional controller, typically the Nunchuck. It was emphatically a family console, as Nintendo is proud to represent, and featured a lot of games involving physical exertion.
							</h5>

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>Wii U</em> is a great family console with an extremely durable and ergonomic controller. Although its game library is not as prolific as previous generations, it is still respectable and fun!

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>PlayStation 2</em> was Square Enix's playground from Sony, and boasts the most extensive gaming library seconded only by PC gaming, and utilized DVDs for their games. There are many great PlayStation exclusive IPs to this day you cannot find on any other line of gaming systems.
							</h5>

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>PlayStation 3</em>, at first, featured backwards compatibility with the PS2; Newer generations lack this functionality to reduce the bulk of the console. It is a powerful console that also features BlueTooth connected controllers with a mini-USB charger, no longer chaining the player to the console. Its games utilize BluRay discs for massive storage capabilities.

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The current generation of Sony console, the <em>PlayStation 4</em> is an absolute upgrade from all previous generations, offering stunning graphics and excellent load times, allowing games to truly flourish. Boasting Sony's famed exclusive library, it is an era defining gaming console.

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>XBox</em>, Microsoft's first forray into the gaming console market, exploded onto the scene with the legendary classic Halo: Combat Evolved, a first-person shooter that revolutionized the genre, and to this day remains the only FPS I enjoy playing.
							</h5>

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>XBox 360</em> is a solid step up from the original XBox in processing power and aesthetic. Microsoft in this generation had begun releasing games cross-platform alongside PC.
							</h5>
						</p><br>

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The <em>XBox One</em>, with confusing name, controversially was to be more of a Home Entertainment System than a gaming console, featuring a cable jack, an always-connected-to-the-internet camera in the Kinect, and other bells and whistles not conducive of gaming. It was also to be released with a necessity to stay connected to the Internet 24/7 or else it would be unusable; This was rapidly altered due to fan outrage. It runs a custom Windows 10 operating system.

						</a>
						<p>
							<h5>The old standby, <em>PC</em> gaming has been around since personal computers were a thing. The library is massive, spanning Steam, GOG, and all other independent publishers. PC's are also capable of running emulators for other systems. It's a fantastic gaming device.

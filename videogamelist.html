				<div class="sega-dreamcast-blurb">
					<p>
						<span>The <em>Sega DreamCast</em> was an ambitious console whose lack of advertisement bit it in the bud and was outsold by the GameCube. This console was ahead of its time with a memory card that had an LCD display with interactive minigames from game save files, akin to Tomagatchis.

					<p>
						<span>The <em>Super Nintendo</em> was the upgrade from the NES, and was where Mario began to flourish, using a new cartridge design with an easy to use eject mechanism. It was also one of the first consoles to get a Game Genie (a cheat cartridge between the game and the console) made for it. This is a classic, and has been rereleased as such!

				<div class="nintendo-64-blurb">
				<p>
					<span>The <em>Nintendo 64</em> was Nintendo's grand entrance into the 3D world of gaming, and they made an incredible splash with Super Mario 64, a beautiful game still being speedrun today. Though dated now, the graphics were incredible for their time, and even had an optional RAM expansion pack for more demanding games like Donkey Kong 64.

				<div class="gamecube-blurb">
				<p>
					<span>The <em>GameCube</em> was a huge step up from the Nintendo 64, and featured Nintendo's version of game discs which were about half the size of standard DVD discs. The GameCube featured incredibly detailed models compared to the polygons of the N64, and also had a separately sold Game Boy adapter that plugged into the bottom, as well as controller adapters to use a Game Boy Advance (SP) as a controller.

				</div>
				<div class="3ds-blurb">
					<p>
						<span>The <em>Nintendo 3DS</em> was, quite frankly, revolutionary at the time, with 3D features requiring no proprietary glasses to view properly, and flash drive game cartridges with massive storage capabilities, as well as having an SD Card slot! The touch screen is also much more refined compared to its predecessor the Nintendo 2DS. The 3DS is also compatible with add-ons such at the second joystick along with additional shoulder buttons, leading to a prolonged and excellent run of quality games. I personally own more 3DS games than any other system except possibly the Playstation 3.

								<p>
									<span>The <em>Wii</em> is the successor to the GameCube, and features a wireless infrared remote control with adapter for additional controller, typically the Nunchuck. It was emphatically a family console, as Nintendo is proud to represent, and featured a lot of games involving physical exertion.

									<span>The <em>PlayStation 2</em> was Square Enix's playground from Sony, and boasts the most extensive gaming library seconded only by PC gaming, and utilized DVDs for their games. There are many great PlayStation exclusive IPs to this day you cannot find on any other line of gaming systems.

							<div class="playstation-3-blurb">
								<p>
									<span>The <em>PlayStation 3</em>, at first, featured backwards compatibility with the PS2; Newer generations lack this functionality to reduce the bulk of the console. It is a powerful console that also features BlueTooth connected controllers with a mini-USB charger, no longer chaining the player to the console. Its games utilize BluRay discs for massive storage capabilities.

								<p>
									<span>The <em>XBox One</em>, with confusing name, controversially was to be more of a Home Entertainment System than a gaming console, featuring a cable jack, an always-connected-to-the-internet camera in the Kinect, and other bells and whistles not conducive of gaming. It was also to be released with a necessity to stay connected to the Internet 24/7 or else it would be unusable; This was rapidly altered due to fan outrage. It runs a custom Windows 10 operating system.
